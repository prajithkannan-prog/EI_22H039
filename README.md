Overview

This repository contains two exercises that demonstrate the application of software design patterns and object-oriented programming principles.

Exercise 1 focuses on implementing examples for different categories of design patterns.

Exercise 2 simulates a Smart Home System that integrates multiple patterns to handle real-world requirements such as automation, scheduling, and device management.

Exercise 1: Design Pattern Use Cases

Problem Statement - Come up with six different use cases to demonstrate an understanding of software design patterns.

Implemented Patterns,

Behavioral Patterns :

Observer Pattern – Weather Station notifying multiple displays.

Strategy Pattern – Payment system with interchangeable payment methods.

Creational Patterns:

Singleton Pattern – Logger that ensures only one instance exists.

Factory Pattern – Shape factory that creates objects based on input.

Structural Patterns:

Adapter Pattern – Media adapter that allows an MP3 player to play MP4 files.

Decorator Pattern – Coffee ordering system with add-ons such as milk and sugar.

Exercise 2: Smart Home System

Problem Statement
Create a simulation for a Smart Home System that allows the user to control devices such as lights, thermostats, and door locks via a central hub.

Functionalities

Initialize the system with different devices (light, thermostat, door lock).

Turn devices on or off.

Schedule devices to activate at a specific time.

Automate tasks (for example, turning off lights when the temperature rises above a set level).

Optionally, add or remove devices dynamically.

Design Patterns Used

Observer Pattern (Behavioral) – Used to update devices whenever a change occurs in the system.

Factory Method (Creational) – Used to create different types of devices.

Proxy Pattern (Structural) – Used to control access to devices.
